# Module 00 Project Assignment:

## OpenGL Project: Implementing 2D Game Movement and Collision Detection

In this project, you will create a simple 2D game using OpenGL. The game will involve controlling a player character and avoiding obstacles by detecting collisions. Apply the concepts learned in this Module, including coordinate systems, transformations, and basic rasterization techniques.

### Requirements:

    Set up a window using OpenGL.
    Create a player character (e.g., a simple square) that can move using keyboard input.
    Implement collision detection between the player character and obstacles (e.g., other squares).
    Display obstacles on the screen.
    Implement a simple scoring system.
    Use appropriate coordinate transformations to ensure smooth movement and collision detection.

## DirectX Project: Implementing 2D Game Movement and Collision Detection

In this project, you will create a similar 2D game using DirectX. Apply the concepts learned in this Module to develop player movement, collision detection, and basic rendering techniques.

### Requirements:

    Set up a window using DirectX.
    Create a player character (e.g., a simple square) that can move using keyboard input.
    Implement collision detection between the player character and obstacles (e.g., other squares).
    Display obstacles on the screen.
    Implement a simple scoring system.
    Use appropriate coordinate transformations to ensure smooth movement and collision detection.

Note: Both projects will allow you to practice implementing the concepts covered in Module 1, such as coordinate systems, transformations, basic rendering, and user input handling. These projects are designed to reinforce your understanding of graphics programming fundamentals and provide hands-on experience with OpenGL and DirectX.
